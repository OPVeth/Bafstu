# "Discover lcnRNA networks in preserved and lesioned OA tissue by integrating RNA profiles using network analysis."
Research Project for Master Computer Science (Bioinformatics)
Internship at LUMC, Molecular Epidemology

The used scripts are mostly written in R which is a statistical programming language which is available to download at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/. 
An open-source program named Rstudio(https://www.rstudio.com/) has been used to create and run the created scripts. 

# "Aim"
As of now, no research has involved lcnRNA profiles in preserved and OA affected tissue to unravel the role of these still quite unknown non-coding RNA parts. Using the newly gained knowledge regarding the role of lcnRNA in OA, biomarkers or potential drug targets. Thus, for clarification, the aim is the following:
â€¢ Discover lcnRNA networks in preserved and lesioned OA tissue by inte-
grating its RNA profiles using network analysis.
